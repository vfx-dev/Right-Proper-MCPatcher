# Right Proper MCPatcher <img src=".idea/icon.png" align="right" width=150>

<sup>**[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mcpatcher) | [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/mcpatcher)**</sup>

A clean and improved reimplementation of MCPatcher features for Minecraft 1.7.10.

This mod provides various features for texture pack artists and modpack designers, such as:

- Random mob textures
  - Mobs can have different textures applied to them, based on biome, height, or even just purely randomized.
- CTM connected textures
  - Connected glass and other block textures, with seamless tiling
- Better Glass
  - Resource packs can provide glass textures with semi-translucent effects

Planned features:

- Custom Colors for grass and water based on biomes
- Custom Skyboxes

## Usage

This mod implements several features based on the OptiFineDoc documentation:

- Connected textures: https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/blob/master/OptiFineDoc/doc/ctm.properties
- Random mobs: https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/blob/master/OptiFineDoc/doc/random_entities.properties

Note: the `ft_default` entry in the ctm properties shipped in this mods jar is an internal implementation detail. Please ignore it, and do not use it in your resource packs!
